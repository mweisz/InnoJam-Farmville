# Python2hana

## Idea
This tool helps you to develop with HANA locally on you computer using the HANA node connector. It can be either used on the server or your local computer.

## Requirements
1. Node.js and NPM installed (http://nodejs.org/download/)

## Setup
1. Checkout repository
2. Run "npm install" inside the project directory
3. Optional: change the port you want to use
4. Run the server using "sudo node server.js" (on you local computer you can run it without sudo except for reserved ports)
5. The Server runs on <ip>:<port> (example: 192.168.30.38:5005)
